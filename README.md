# Lottery contract

A simple lottery contract with a psuedo-random-number generator to pick the winner.

to join the contract you need to send some test eth and the manager account calls the `pickWinner` function

the total eth in the contract gets sent to the winner.

p.s. this was built with the 0.4.17 version of solidity. use npm 16.
